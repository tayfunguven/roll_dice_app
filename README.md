# Dice Roller App 

## Overview
The Dice Roller App is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the fundamentals of Dart and Flutter for mobile app development. The app simulates rolling two dice, providing a visual representation of the dice faces.

You can find my fundamental notes for Flutter & Dart on my Notion : [tayfunguven.notion.site | Flutter&Dart](https://tayfunguven.notion.site/Flutter-Dart-200348874a4d4eeba14464f49206fbaf?pvs=4)


## Features
- Randomly generates two dice faces on button press.
- Utilizes Flutter's state management for dynamic UI updates.
- Demonstrates the use of custom widgets for modular and reusable code.

## Getting Started
To run the app locally, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed. If not, follow the instructions in the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tayfunguven/roll_dice_app.git
  ```
## Usage
- Press the "Roll" button to generate random dice faces.
- Explore the code to understand key Dart and Flutter concepts.
- Customize and extend the app as a foundation for your Flutter projects.

## Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

- lib/custom_button.dart: Contains the CustomElevatedButton widget for the roll button.
